He slipped near a crevice and plummeted thousands of feet into the pitch dark shadows. If I left his body without a proper burial, his soul would be doomed to haunt the mountains for eternity, so I set off after him, climbing down into the crevice myself. It wasn't long until I heard his voice echoing below me. Instead of fear and pain, his voice was filled with excitement. I saw why when I rounded a corner. He was swimming in a vast, heated underground lake, lit by glowing rocks that were embedded into the roof of the cave. Not only was thankful that my friend had survived his fall, but I was happy to dive into the warm water after many days of traversing the cold hard face of the Amarinthe Mountain range.",

I do wish that there was a way for me to find my way home someday, but I feel that too much time has passed. My wish, it seems, would be to turn back time itself.",
